# Precision-Digital-Protractor
A project to build and interface a precision digital protractor to a faceting machine giving a resolution of 1/40 degree. The system employs a US Digital E6 Optical Encoder, Arduino Nano and Waveshare 1.5" colour OLED display.

This may be of interest to those interested in adding such a system to a faceting machine or any device where the angle of rotation needs to be measured. The code may be adapted to read from other rotarty optical encoders. It also may provide a template for those wishing to drive the Waveshare OLED display for other projects.

n.b. the Arduino sketch is adapted from Tom Herbst's excellent code described in his highly recommended 'Amateur Gemstone Faceting vol 2'. Any errors introduced are my own.
